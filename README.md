# Flee
 
 ## Overview
"Flee" is an engaging, fast-paced game developed with Unity and C#, conceived and created as part of my Game Development course at Cegep Du Vieux Montreal. Designed to be a brief 2-5 minute immersive experience, it showcases my ability to apply classroom learning to a fun and functional game.

## Gameplay
In "Flee", players take on the role of an asteroid in space. The game commences with a supernova explosion, triggering the need for the player to escape the imminent blast zone. Along the way, players must evade enemy spaceships and planets to reach a safe warp zone.

In the ensuing level, the challenge escalates. Players not only have to continue their interstellar navigation but must now also dodge missiles from enemy turrets. The game concludes upon reaching a massive spaceship â€“ an inescapable encounter for our asteroid protagonist!
